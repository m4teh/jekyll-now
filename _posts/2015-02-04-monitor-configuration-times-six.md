I upgraded my monitor set up a few months ago and forgot to blog about it.

These are all 27″ Dell U2713HM monitors that I acquired over the past two years. I was originally only having three, then I got carried away with discount purchases.
The pixel real estate is amazing. It’s also nice having both vertical and horizontal screens for application specific use.
