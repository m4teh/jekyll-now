The AlerteGPS 700 unit by Wikango is a GPS based device that reads a database of fixed, red light and point-to-point speed cameras to alert a driver of their presence and location.

The unit is not a radar detector and is completely legal to own and operate in any state or country. It is no different to ordinary nav devices, such as Garmin or Navman. The device will also alert you to known mobile camera hotspots, school zones (with time support, so you will not be notified outside of school-zone hours), and railway crossings/danger spots.

I have been looking at purchasing a similar device in the past, namely, the Cheetah C50. There is a very large user base for the Cheetah unit and a not-so-large customer base for the Wikango unit (so it seems). 
At first, I was reluctant to purchase the 700. I struggled to find many (if any at all) English reviews or YouTube demonstrations. I bit the bullet and purchased one anyway, considering Ryda.com.au had it on sale for $118 (delivered free with a coupon found on OzBargain). The Wikango features free, lifetime database updates and there are absolutely no hidden costs or fees. The Cheetah unit costs more (around the AU 170 mark if I remember correctly), and then you need to pay ongoing subscriptions fees on top of this to keep the database/device current. The thing I liked about this company was that the AlerteGPS website has their comprehensive camera database available online, so I was able to verify some common speed camera locations for authenticity prior to purchasing.

After receiving the unit and going about some testing, I couldn’t really be happier. It essentially does everything I want. The device is considerably smaller than I imagined it would be. There is adequate notification and timing when approaching speed cameras. It will generally notify about 500m away and then count down in metres until you ‘PASS’ the camera.Here are some good and bad points:

**Good**

- Unit has an ‘eco’ mode which disables the screen until it needs to notify you of a camera. Otherwise, speed is displayed on screen.

- Directional camera notification. You won’t get a notification if there isn’t a camera pointing in your direction of travel.
- Speaker is loud
- Audible Australian voice
- Free lifetime database updates
- Email support is responsive
- Time based school zone alerts
- Price
- Small in size
- Can enable and disable specific types of alerts (e.g. railway crossing, mobile cameras) and/or disable the voice notification and just keep a beep notification

**Bad**

- Sound only adjustable in three increments. Very loud on the first setting.

- Charging cord isn’t very long. Can’t run a hidden install, mine is currently running the cord direct from cigarette plug to the dash, which is messy looking..
- PC software was interesting to install but maybe that’s because I’m running Windows 8. The USB driver must be installed separately and this is not stated anywhere.

The device will also do cool things like display your calculated, average speed when in the middle of a point to point camera. In the box is a magnetic mount with an adhesive bottom that you can stick to the dash (or another location of your choice) of your car.

Overall, very very happy with the unit. It does everything you would expect with a GPS speed camera notification device. The free database upgrades, time based school zone notifications and GPS speed displayed on screen accompanied with the very fair price tag, make this a very attractive unit. I honestly couldn’t see a reason for anyone to consider the Cheetah GPS. 

I hope that the quality of this unit is consistent with what I have seen thus far, in future. Summer will be interesting, as it gets very hot in Australia and the temperature in vehicles can be extreme. Hopefully the device is not easily heat affected. I would tuck the device away so it’s not in direct sunlight when it becomes warmer.
