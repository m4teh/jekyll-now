So here we are. 

After almost six years running a dual core E6850 and a shitty video card, the new build has arrived.

I placed the order for the above components the other night. I decided not to build it myself as.. well.. quite frankly, I just can’t be bothered. 
I’ve built many computers in the past and I’d rather pay somebody to do it for me since money isn’t an issue. 

In addition to the new rig, I went for the Sennheiser HD800 headphones. They’re an epic piece of hardware. The STX sound card will power them for now until I get myself a decent amp. I’ll post pictures and follow up blog posts once it is all set up and functioning!
