I upgraded my ([old](/new-pc-build)) workstation several months ago and sold most of the monitors and desktop components.

Now featuring a [Dell XPS 15 9560](http://www.dell.com/au/p/xps-15-9560-laptop/pd?ref=PD_OC) 2017 model, 2 x [U2713HM monitors](/dell-u2713hm-ahips-monitors) and a [Dell TB16 Thunderbolt Dock](http://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-business-thunderbolt-dock-tb16-with-240w-adapter/apd/452-bcnu/pc-accessories).

Inspired by working in a corporate setting where much of the work is conducted on laptops in dynamic environments, I decided I didn't want to be locked down to a desktop set up anymore. I wanted something that had the power and beast-like attitude of a desktop PC, but was fully portable and could be taken anywhere.

The XPS 9560 was just released, there was an eBay sale + Dell coupon available (giving me a 30% discount off RRP) so I decided to go for it!

After months of use... I have not been disappointed!


**Features:**

- 7th Gen i7-7700HQ Quad Core
- 20GB DDR4-2400Mhz RAM
- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050
- 15.6" FHD (1920x1080) InfinityEdge display

I decided to go for the FHD as opposed to the 4k screen, despite this being a tough decision. I'd mostly be using them with 2 x external U2713HM monitors anyway, so the resolution didn't bother me too much. I'd rather save the cash and have battery life advantages.

The InfinityEdge (extremely thin bezel) is simply beautiful. I don't think I could go back to a thick bezel again after using something as wonderful as this.

The TB16 dock allows for multiple monitor configurations and ports, extra USB ports, ethernet and some other stuff that compliments a desktop workstation quite well. It seemed a nature fit and I'm glad I dished out the extra cash on it.

I'm also using a [Rain Design mStand](http://www.raindesigninc.com/mstand.html) which is adds to the aesthetics of the whole set up. Levelling the laptop screen with the monitor screens is also a nice touch. Looking down at desk-height can be bothersome.

I can't forget the keyboard either â€• the [Dell WK717 Bluetooth/Wireless keyboard](http://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-premier-wireless-keyboard-wk717/apd/580-aflj/pc-accessories). Weighing about 400g, it's very light. The typing is incredible. Really quiet, feels good to type on. Probably one of the best keyboards I have owned. Each key press feels lovely and pushy!
It has never missed a beat (a key, in this circumstance) and the Bluetooth performance is rock solid. The function keys even translate for different operating systems (even MacOS in a virtual machine!)
