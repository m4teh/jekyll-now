I had been looking for a monitor upgrade for a while now. I guess it was just a matter of getting the funds together. I’ve been using a single 22″ LCD and only very recently started using a spare 22″ in dual configuration.I looked at the Kogan 27″ monitor when they first released it. In all honesty, it didn’t appeal to me very much. The first generation monitor had a 12ms response time, and the stand would only tilt.

<!-- more -->


Kogan has since released a newer version of the monitor with impressive enhancements. The response time has been slashed to 6.5ms and the stand now tilts, swivels and is height adjustable.It is speculated that Kogan use the LG LM270WQ1 panel, the same kind found in the Apple Thunderbolt displays.
There is absolutely no complaints with colour, clarity, quality, usability or.. anything really. It seems like a perfectly suitable piece of hardware, especially for it’s price!

I do have a dead pixel on the bottom right corner of the second screen, but given my viewing angle and the pixel density on the 1440p monitor, it’s really not worth my time going through the hassle of replacing it. After all, Kogan isn’t renown for it’s track record with customer service and/or warranty claims.If you’re deciding whether or not to get a Kogan 27″, or you’re fairly price conscious, I say go for it. It’s certainly not going to be a purchase that you regret.
You can read more reviews on this monitor from [PC World](http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/review/kogan/27_led_monitor/452678/) or [Internode](http://games.on.net/2013/04/massive-monitor-roundup-which-monitor-gives-you-the-best-gaming-experience/). Take note that some reviewers may be relating to features from the first generation, which did NOT have stand swivel or height adjustment.I have attached some images of my setup below. I will be purchasing a third monitor soon, however my current graphics card will only support two inputs, so it’ll only be used when I upgrade my machine in the not too distant future.
