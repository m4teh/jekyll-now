This is a little post describing the Kogan warranty experience for those thinking about making a purchasing with them. For those that haven’t read my last blog post, I recently ordered two 27″ IPS displays from Kogan.

I mentioned that there was a dead pixel in the bottom right hand corner and that I wasn’t going to bother with a replacement. I changed my mind and decided I will utilise their zero dead pixel replacement program.

I lodged a warranty claim on the 11th August 2013. I received an email within half an hour, which is great for Sunday. I was asked to provide a photo of the dead pixel in question. I was at work by this point, so I emailed a photo that evening.
I heard back on the 13th August 2013 with an acknowledgement that there may be a fault with the product.

A link is also sent which enables you to submit your details in order for a return AusPost eParcel slip to be generated. This slip is emailed to you within 24 hours. Once the slip has been emailed, you simply attach the slip to the box and return it to the post office. All postage is paid. Be mindful, it is important to keep the box/packaging in case you need to send it back for this exact reason. I posted my monitors first thing Wednesday morning.

I received an email the next day advising that my monitor had been received and to allow up to seven days for inspection and replacement.

I had the courier knock on my door this morning with my new monitor. I didn’t know it was coming until it arrived. Conveniently, the Kogan replacement unit-shipment email was sent to me after I took delivery of my monitor this morning. No big deal.

All in all, Kogan have been good to deal with for a budget company. I can’t really complain. I recently had a HP printer warranty replacement, and HP organises a 1:1 exchange of the product. This means that they ship a new unit out, and the courier takes the faulty unit back with them. This is obviously a much nicer and smoother process, but I wouldn’t expect Kogan to operate that way, given the nature of their business and pricing models.
